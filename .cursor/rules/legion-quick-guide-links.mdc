# Link Keywords and Modifiers to Legion Quick Guide

Whenever you add a new keyword, toggle, or control that adjusts attack/defense dice pools or outcomes:

1. **Look up the rule** at [Legion Quick Guide](https://legionquickguide.com/). Find the matching entry (e.g. Critical X, Backup, Low Profile). Anchor format is lowercase with hyphens: `critical-x`, `low-profile`, `surge-tokens`.

2. **Add the link in the UI** using the existing pattern:
   - For `NumberInputWithControls`: pass `guideAnchor="anchor-name"` (e.g. `guideAnchor="critical-x"`).
   - For `CheckboxToggle`: pass `guideAnchor="anchor-name"` (e.g. `guideAnchor="backup"`).
   - Links open in a new tab (`target="_blank"`); use `legionQuickGuideHref(anchor)` from `src/legionQuickGuide.ts`.

3. **If the term is not on Legion Quick Guide**, omit `guideAnchor`; do not link to the homepage. Add a link only when there is a specific anchor for that rule.

This keeps the calculator aligned with official rules and helps users jump to definitions without leaving the app flow.
